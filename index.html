            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <!-- Requirement-1.G -->
            <p>
                Hello, thank you for checking out my website! My name is Francis Rodriguez and I'm a current student studying CS @ Cal Poly Pomona. <br>
                I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree and I hope to graduate by the end of 2023! Currently, I'm working on projects and brushing up on <br>
                my problem solving skills so that I could (fingers crossed) get an internship this summer.

            <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
                I have two important hobbies that I hold dear to my heart: <b>Music</b> and <b>Video Games</b>. <br>

                <h4>Music</h4>
                <p>
                    I feel that music is an integral part of my life, and my life would be very boring without it. In middle school and high school, <br>
                    I was part of the band and I played percussion (snare drum, bass drum, marimba, etc.) I've grown to love all types of genres, ranging <br>
                    from classical to progressive metal. The genres I am currently listening to are R&B, Electronic, Prog Metal, and Rock. My favorite band <br>
                    right now is called Polyphia, which is a prog metal group. I've learned how to play the piano, drum set, and four-mallet instruments. <br>
                    Currently, I'm coaching high school kids for percussion in Lake Elsinore! <br>

                </p>
                
                <h4>Video Games</h4>
                <p>
                    I've played video games since I was little, and it's the hobby that I've most wasted my time on. My favorite game genres are FPSes (first-person <br>
                    shooters), MOBAs (multiplayer online battle arena), open-world, RPGs (role-playing games), sandbox games, and rhythm games. I mostly played on <br>
                    Xbox when I was a kid--playing FPSes like Call of Duty and Halo-- and I slowly transitioned to PC gaming. On PC, I mainly play Overwatch and League of <br>
                    Legends, but I like playing sandbox games like Factorio and Terraria. My favorite game right now is the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on Nintendo Switch. <br>

                </p>

                <h4>Music + Video Games</h4>
                <p>
                    Rhythm games are my number one favorite genre of game to play right now. I guess it's natural for my two favorite hobbies to become even better <br>
                    when they're combined. :)   I used to play a PC rhythm game called Osu! when I was younger; in the game, you would click circles to the beat of the <br>
                    song. Currently, I'm obsessed with DanceDanceRevolution and another game called Sound Voltex. I go to Round1 (an arcade) regularly to play rhythm games. <br>
